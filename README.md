fbx-conv
========

Command line utility using the FBX SDK to convert FBX/Collada/Obj files
to more runtime friendly formats. The FBX content is parsed into an
in-memory datastructure. Ouput format writers then take this datastructure
to generate the output.

The parser is largely based on GamePlay SDK's encoder. We'll try to 
back-port any bug fixes or improvements.
